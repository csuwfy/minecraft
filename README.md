## 🚀 Overview

</p>

Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have significantly expanded the capabilities of embodied AI. However, real-time decision-making in complex 3D environments remains extremely challenging — requiring high-resolution perception, tactical reasoning, and sub-second reaction times.

To address these challenges, we introduce **CombatVLA**, an efficient **3B Vision-Language-Action model** tailored for combat tasks in 3D action role-playing games (ARPGs). CombatVLA is trained on large-scale video–action pairs collected using an action tracker, with a compact **Action-of-Thought (AoT)** training paradigm.

CombatVLA integrates seamlessly into an optimized action execution framework and supports efficient inference through our **truncated AoT strategy**. Experiments show that CombatVLA:

- Outperforms all existing models in combat understanding  
- Achieves **50× acceleration** in efficient combat  
- Surpasses **human players** in task success rate

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChenVoid/CombatVLA.git
cd CombatVLA
```

---

### 2. Environment Setup

OS: Windows 10/11 (capable of running *Black Myth: Wukong*)
```bash
conda create -n framework python=3.9
conda activate framework
pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Download best-matching version of specific model for your spaCy installation
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

---

### 3. Download Videosubfinder
Download the videosubfinder from https://sourceforge.net/projects/videosubfinder/ and extract the files into the res/tool/subfinder folder. We have already created the folder for you and included a test.srt, which is a required dummy file that will not affect results.

The file structure should be like this:

```
├── res
  ├── tool
    ├── subfinder
      ├── VideoSubFinderWXW.exe
      ├── test.srt
      ├── ...
```

Then please use res/tool/general.clg to overwrite res/tool/subfinder/settings/general.cfg file.

---

### 4. Configure API Endpoint

Deploy CombatVLA or your fine-tuned VLM on a cloud server (e.g., with vLLM) and expose an OpenAI-compatible API.

Set environment variables to drive CombatVLA or your fine-tuned VLM:

```env
COMBATVLA_API_URL="https://<your-server-ip>:8000/v1"
COMBATVLA_API_KEY="your_api_key"
COMBATVLA_MODEL="CombatVLA"
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Framework

```
python runner.py
```

This launches the efficient game control framework powered by CombatVLA.

## Minecraft Three-Stage Training

This fork includes a public-data Minecraft VLA training scaffold under
`training/`. It keeps large datasets and checkpoints out of GitHub and provides
Linux scripts for downloading, converting, validating, and running the
paper-style three-stage schedule on rented GPUs.

See [`TRAINING_MINECRAFT.md`](TRAINING_MINECRAFT.md).

Quick path:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_l20_env.sh
conda activate combatvla-train
bash scripts/download_minecraft_datasets.sh
bash scripts/convert_minecraft_datasets.sh
bash scripts/train_three_stage.sh
```
